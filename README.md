# Quantum_computing_applications
Running algorithms for optimization use cases that employ VQE and QAOA to name a few

Use cases in chemistry, physics and finance will be demonstrated  using Quantum computing  frameworks, such as Pennylane AI and IBM Qiskit. The back end compute infrastructure for these problems will be hybrid classical and quantum computing processors.
